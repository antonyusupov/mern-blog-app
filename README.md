# MERN Blog App

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Blog App. This project is my first full-stack project, and I've learned a lot along the way.

## Introduction

This blog app allows users to Login, Sign up, Create and Read blogs. 

## Project Journey

During the development of this app, I encountered various challenges, such as synchronizing the frontend and backend, handling authentication with JWT, and dealing with different issues. 
I'd like to share my experiences and learnings to help others on their development journey.
This was great journey, since I had experience with Python Django making the backend was easy to understand.
Challenge started when I tried to connect frontend and backend. When I was sending requests to database my devices clock wasn't correct that took some time to figure,
since I was using the Vite + React connecting it with backend little different from CRA (create-react-app).

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- MongoDB: [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/]
- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/en/docs]
- Express.js: [https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html]

### Frontend
